Design (40 marks). Things to consider:
What are the key elements for this application?
Create React App and React XP

How would you manage these?
Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. 

ReactXP is like a big library for the development of cross-platform apps. If you write your app with the help of ReactXP, it will allow you to share the view, definitions, animations, and styles on the different targeted platforms. In addition to this, developers will have the option to provide a specific platform with the use of specific UI variants.

Is a state-managed solution appropriate here? 
Solution publishers for managed solutions play an important role in releasing updates for managed solutions. You can create a new managed solution that updates a previously published managed solution using the same solution publisher.
 

Intelligent Choices (40 marks). Identify appropriate libraries and a toolstack.
Other libraries that can be used are Vue, Angular.js and angular.
Think about how your choice of tools reflects the design. Can you avoid writing code (no code) or writing very little (low code)? 
No, we cannot avid to write the code. In order to run, we need to write the code.
Is this an entirely front-end application, back-end, or full-stack? It is a full stack application.
NOTE: It will be important to think about how you find/choose words for the game.
